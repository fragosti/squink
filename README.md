## To Start Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Configure Environment

Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the appropriate variables.

### Run

```bash
yarn start
```

To run on a testnet, make a copy of `.env.local.example` named `.env.local`, change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_ID` to `"{yourNetworkId}"`, and change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_URL` to e.g. `"https://{yourNetwork}.infura.io/v3/{yourKey}"`.

## Contributions

**Please open all pull requests against the `beta` branch.** CI checks will run against all PRs. To ensure that your changes will pass, run `yarn check:all` before pushing. If this command fails, you can try to automatically fix problems with `yarn fix:all`, or do it manually.
